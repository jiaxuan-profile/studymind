# StudyMind - AI-Powered Study Assistant

StudyMind is an intelligent study assistant that helps students understand and connect information using AI. It features automatic concept extraction, smart summarization, and vector similarity search for related content.

## Learning Approach

StudyMind supports both formative and summative assessment strategies:

### Formative Assessment
- **Continuous Learning**: Regular practice questions and review sessions spread across your study period
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor your understanding with spaced repetition
- **Immediate Feedback**: Get instant AI-powered explanations and concept clarifications
- **Self-Assessment**: Generate practice questions to test your knowledge
- **Adaptive Learning**: Focus more on challenging concepts based on your performance

### Summative Assessment
- **Exam Preparation**: Comprehensive review of all covered material
- **Knowledge Synthesis**: Connect concepts across different topics
- **Mock Tests**: Generate exam-style questions to assess overall understanding
- **Performance Analytics**: Track your readiness for final assessments

   - Notes table with vector embeddings
   - Concepts and relationships
   - User authentication and RLS policies
   - Vector similarity search functions

2. **User Data Initialization** (`20250604144012_blue_sun.sql`)
   - Default subjects for existing users
   - Data migration for existing notes

3. **Review System** (`20250607102614_twilight_dew.sql`)
   - Review answers table for storing user responses
